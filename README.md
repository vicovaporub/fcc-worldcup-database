# World Cup Database

## This project is required for the [freeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.org)'s Relational Database certification and uses a combination of Bash and PostgreSQL to create a database for the final three rounds of the World Cup tournament from 2014 and 2018. It includes the year, round, winner, opponent, and the number of goals each team scored in each game.
